There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.


# Intuition
Pick copy and pen

Do some dry runs for n=2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13

You will find that if n is a prime number, you have to do exactly n moves

So you just need to find out all the prime factors of n

# Time: O(logn)
# Space: O(1)


class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        if(n==1)    return 0;

        int steps=0, factor=2;

        while(n>1)
        {
            while(n%factor==0)
            {
                steps += factor;
                n /= factor;
            }
            factor++;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
}
